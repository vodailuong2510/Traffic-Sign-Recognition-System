# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-System
# Overview
This project focuses on developing a traffic sign recognition system capable of identifying 43 different classes of traffic signs. Using deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model is trained on a dataset containing labeled images of traffic signs. The trained model can then classify input images of traffic signs into one of the 43 classes with high accuracy.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of images of traffic signs from various sources, with each image labeled with one of the 43 classes representing different types of signs. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.

# Model
The traffic sign recognition model is built using CNNs, leveraging convolutional and pooling layers to extract features from input images. The final layers consist of fully connected layers responsible for classifying the input images into one of the 43 classes.
# Contribution
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have any ideas for improving the traffic sign recognition system or implementing new features, feel free to contribute.
